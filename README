Turtle is a small (271 sloc) stacking window manager written in Rust. It aims to
be simple while providing enough features to be practical for everyday use.

=== CONFIGURATION
=================

Turtle can be configured by editing the config file located at 
~/.config/turtle/config.ron. If this file doesn't exist you will need to create
it for turtle to start. Try copying config.ron from this repo as a starting place
for your configuration.

Turtle also supports running a startup script. To do this create
~/.config/turtle/autostart and give it executable permissions. This script will then
be run every time turtle is started.

=== INSTALLATION
================

1. Run 'cargo build --release' and copy target/release/turtle to your path
2. Copy config.ron to ~/.config/turtle/config.ron
3. Start turtle through xinit or by creating a .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/

=== WORKSPACES
==============

Turtle doesn't have workspaces. You can cycle forwards / backwards through open
windows or switch to the last focused window though.

=== POSSIBLE FUTURE ADDITIONS
=============================

- window borders
- on-the-fly config reloading
