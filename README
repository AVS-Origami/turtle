Turtle is a small and simple stacking window
manager written in Rust. It aims to be simple
while providing enough features to be practical for
everyday use.

=== CONFIGURATION
=================

Turtle can be configured by editing the config file
located at ~/.config/turtle/config.ron. If this
file doesn't exist you will need to create it for
turtle to start. Try copying config.ron from this
repo as a starting place for your configuration.

Turtle also supports running a startup script. To
do this create ~/.config/turtle/autostart and give
it executable permissions. This script will then be
run every time turtle is started.

=== WORKSPACES
==============

Turtle doesn't have workspaces. You can cycle
forwards / backwards through open windows or switch
to the last focused window though.

=== POSSIBLE FUTURE ADDITIONS
=============================

- window borders
- on-the-fly config reloading
